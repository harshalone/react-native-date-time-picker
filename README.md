# Date Picker and Time Picker Components for React Native

This repository provides reusable Date Picker and Time Picker components for React Native projects. These components are designed to be easy to integrate and customise according to your project's requirements.

## Installation

To use these components in your React Native project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have `react-native` and `react-native-modal` installed in your project. If not, you can install them using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install react-native react-native-modal
   # or
   yarn add react-native react-native-modal
   ```

2. **Install the Date Picker and Time Picker Components**

   You can install these components directly from this GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   npm install <github-repo-url>
   # or
   yarn add <github-repo-url>
   ```

   Replace `<github-repo-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository where the components are hosted.

## Usage

Here's how you can use the Date Picker and Time Picker components in your React Native project:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import DateInput from 'path/to/DateInput'; // Replace with the correct path
import TimeInput from 'path/to/TimeInput'; // Replace with the correct path

function App() {
  const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState('');
  const [selectedTime, setSelectedTime] = useState('');

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
      <DateInput
        title="Select Date"
        setDate={setSelectedDate}
        wrapperClass="my-1" // Optional: Custom CSS classes
        required={true} // Optional: Whether the field is required
      />
      <Text style={{ marginVertical: 10 }}>Selected Date: {selectedDate}</Text>

      <TimeInput
        title="Select Time"
        setTime={setSelectedTime}
        wrapperClass="my-1" // Optional: Custom CSS classes
        required={true} // Optional: Whether the field is required
